# Easy pong game!
This is a pong game that I wrote for my final task in grade 10. It is fairly basic to use and to understand. If you want to add your own background music just add a directory called "sounds" in your main htmlfinal folder and call the .mp3 "music". It should automaticly pull the audio file from "sounds/music.mp3".
